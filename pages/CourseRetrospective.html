    G.K. Chesterton wrote, “If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.”
    Zig Ziglar refines this idea with his own quote, “Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly--until you can learn to do it well.”
    A good habit for “continual process improvement” is to complete a retrospective
    any time you have come to the end of a major activity in work (and life in general).
    <br>
    <br>
    Retrospectives, formerly known by the darker term “post-mortems,” have become popular in the Agile software development community
    and are healthy activity for any individual or group effort. The basic process is simple: take time to answer a few questions
    about your experiences in a given activity, and synthesize the results into concrete actions
    that can be applied the next time you are starting a similar kind of effort.
    <br>

    <h4>Retrospective questions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> What worked well for us?</li>
        <li> What did not work well for us?</li>
        <li> What actions can we take to improve our process going forward?</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Approach:</h4>
    <p class="text-justify">A universally valuable approach for accurate prediction is to develop <strong><em>models</em></strong> of the entities and relationships
    that are elements in your decision-making process. Models help you to identify and reason about the essentials
    and eliminate aspects that are secondary or irrelevant.</p>

    <h4> In-class exercise: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Review the activities we have done in CSCI 373 throughout the semester.
            See the course
            <a href="">Website</a> and
            <a href="">Handbook</a> to form the complete list.
        </li>
        <li> Using Google Docs and in small group</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Develop the list of activities we have done this semester, include written and speaking assignments,
                reading/listening/viewing reflections and in-class activities and assignments.
            </li>
            <li>Collect individual responses to each of the above three questions for each activity in your group document.</li>
            <li>Discuss individual responses as a group and synthesize your responses for the third question for each activity.</li>
        </ol>
